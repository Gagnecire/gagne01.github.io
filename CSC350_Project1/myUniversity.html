        <h1> Borough of Manhattan Community College</h1>
        <p> Borough of Manhattan Community College , commonly known as BMCC, is located at 199 Chambers Street, in the lively Tribeca neighborhood of New York City. BMCC was founded in 1963 and opened in 1964 as a small, primarily business-oriented community college offering programs aimed at the business community.<br>
      Originally located in two floors of a commercial building in midtown Manhattan, the college focused on preparing 
      students for business careers and on providing a liberal arts education to students who wished to transfer to four-year 
      colleges. The college also created on-site training and management development courses for mid-level employees. 
      BMCC continuously modified its in-house and on-site programs.</p>
